generator-cli
=========

*A project generator like yeoman written in python*


Purpose
-------
It's a work in progress, but ideally I want better cli tools for:
 - easily integrating webpack projects
 - easily use js view library within current monlith framework (Django, Rails ect.)
 - better scaffolding of django api (using djangorest for now)
 - deploy django app like a firebase app using rsync
 - ...
